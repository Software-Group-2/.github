# UnReveal

## Purpose 

Whenever people go to visit a new town, the most recommended places by the major trip advisor apps are common, traditional, and overrated places, that took advantage of foreign people to raise the prices. Not only foreign people, but even locals might not know what kind of preciosities might exist around their residences. If often happens that roaming around a city, people would find precious places that no one recommended them, and those sites only get to be known in informal ways, not really having the chance of getting their spot in the light. 

To work in this scenario, comes UNREVEAL. An app that lets you add your treasured found places, and see other users treasured places too! By creating a community, you can rate the places you like the most, add reviews, and help new locations to be found by locals or foreigners. 

## Description 

The major system capabilities are an application that allows travelers who visit underrated places and can share it worldwide so that everyone acknowledges the destination and values the culture and customs of the country. 

The product consists of an Application Programming Interface (API) that will communicate with a database to store accounts information, places, comments, and reviews uploaded by users. The product should also have search features, a list of places given a criteria, and the capability to register and log in users.â€¯To communicate and display information to the user, UNREVEAL will have a front-end program, meant to be used on smartphones.
